Task

Design an intelligent agent that simulates a Miner  on a rectangular grid of nxn squares. We set n to be from 8 to 64.  

The starting point for the Miner is always the square 1,1, on the upper left-hand corner of the grid, at row 1 and column 1. 

Somewhere on the grid is a unique golden square that contains the POT OF GOLD.  The agent finds its way to the golden square, and the shorter the path travelled,

the more rational is the agent.
