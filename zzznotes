UPDATE:
- slow (250 ms) and fast (1500 ms) Speed for Miner
- user can now choose AI level and Miner Speed during the Board display
- BFS can be activated from GUI (only displays path AFTER it is discovered,    not DURING)
- implement scanCount into GUI
- randomized Front of Miner
- implement Smart Search into GUI
- able to reset Miner to be able to use multiple AI levels with a single board state
- GUI FULLY WORKS NA YEE


TO-DO: 
- tried to catch OutOfMemory error but the program crashes before displaying    error in GUI (maybe it's not possible lel)

FROM MCO1:
AGENT RATIONALITY
The locations of the pits and beacons are variables. The paths cannot be explored ahead before the miner moves. The most intelligent agent will be determined by comparing the average number of squares that were traversed to reach the golden square.
